# Work-Samples

**Python Project**
The following project samples are in R and Python. In this school project, I was tasked with comparing the total cost for three different scenarios of opening a waste plant through a thirty-year range. Additionally, I was asked to create two separate tables one for an interest rate of 4% and another for an interest rate of 3%.
