# Work-Samples

**Python Project**

The following project samples are in R and Python. In this school project, I was tasked with comparing the total cost for three different scenarios of opening a waste plant through a thirty-year range. Additionally, I was asked to create two separate tables one for an interest rate of 4% and another for an interest rate of 3%.

**R Project**

Using R I was able to build a program for my job as a data analyst for the Wilson College of Textiles that sorted orientation survey responses given to students based on the semester or major. The program outputs an Excel file for each semester/major and the file is categorized as student response, the frequency of the word, and then the question number.
