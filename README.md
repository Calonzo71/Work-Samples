# Work-Samples

**Python Project**

In this school project, I undertook a comparative analysis of total costs associated with three different scenarios of opening a waste plant over a thirty-year period. The primary task involved creating projections for each scenario. Additionally, I was required to generate two separate tablesâ€”one for an interest rate of 4% and another for an interest rate of 3%. For the Python project, I utilized programming skills to develop a comprehensive model. The analysis covered a range of financial aspects related to the waste plant, providing insights into the varying costs associated with different scenarios over the specified time frame.

**R Projet**

In the R project, I applied my programming skills as a data analyst for the Wilson College of Textiles. The objective was to organize and analyze orientation survey responses from students, categorizing them based on the semester or major. The program I created produces individual Excel files for each semester/major combination, detailing student responses, word frequency, and question numbers. This initiative enhanced the efficiency of survey data management and facilitated a more organized approach to understanding student feedback.

Overall, these projects showcase my proficiency in both Python and R, demonstrating my ability to apply programming languages to real-world scenarios and deliver valuable insights.
